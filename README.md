# Smokers-and-non-smokers-Analysis
This project explores customer spending patterns to help the restaurant plan its festive season expansion. It compares the total bills of smoking versus non-smoking customers using data visualization and identifies the busiest days of the week. The goal is to provide actionable insights for space allocation in the restaurant.
